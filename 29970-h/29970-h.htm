<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The Little Dinners of Paris are world-famous.
No one can have sojourned
in the fascinating capital in its normal
days without having come under their
spell. To Parisien and visitor alike
they are accounted among the uniquely
characteristic features of the city's
routine life.</p>

<p>Much of the interest that attaches to
them is, of course, due to local atmosphere,
to the associations that surround
the quaint restaurants, half hidden in
unexpected nooks and by-ways, to the
fact that old Jacques &ldquo;waits&rdquo; in his
shirtsleeves or that Grosse Marie serves
you with a smile as expansive as her
own proportions, or that it is Justin or
François or &ldquo;Old Monsoor,&rdquo; with his
eternal grouch, who glides about the
zinc counter.</p>

<p>But there is also magic in the arrangement
of the menus, in the combinations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi">vi</a></span>of food, in the very names of the confections
and in the little Gallic touches
that, simple though they are, transform
commonplace dishes into gastronomic
delights.</p>

<p>There is inspiration in the art that
enters into the production of a French
dinner, in the perfect balance of every
item from hors d'&oelig;uvre to café noir,
in the ways with seasoning that work
miracles with left-overs and preserve
the daily routine of three meals a day
from the deadly monotony of the
American régime, in the garnishings
that glorify the most insignificant concoctions
into objects of appetising
beauty and in the sauces that elevate
indifferent dishes into the realm of
creations and enable a French cook to
turn out a dinner fit for capricious
young gods from what an American
cook wastes in preparing one.</p>

<p>The very economy of the French is
an art, and there is art in their economy.
It is true that their dishes, as we have
known them in this country, are expensive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii">vii&ndash;viii</a></span>even extravagant, but that is because
they have been for the most part
the creations of high-priced chefs. They
who have made eating an avocation
know that it is not necessary to dine
expensively in order to dine well.</p>

<h2>THE BUGBEAR OF AMERICAN
COOKERY&mdash;MONOTONY</h2>


<p>It is as strange as it is true that with
the supplies that have lately proved
sufficient to feed a world to draw upon
the chief trouble with American cookery
is its monotony. The American cook
has a wider variety of foods at his command
than any other in the world, yet
in the average home how rarely is it
that the palate is surprised with a flavor
that didn't have its turn on the corresponding
day last week or tickled
with a sauce that is in itself an inspiration
and a delight, not a mere &ldquo;gravy,&rdquo;
liable to harden into lumps of grease
when it cools.</p>

<p>Most of this is simply the result of
blindly following tradition. Daughter
has accepted mother's precepts, regarding
them even as the law of the Medes
and the Persians, &ldquo;which altereth not,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>and if it were not that increased prices
and, lately, at least, &ldquo;food regulations,&rdquo;
have veritably compelled her toward a
more wholesome simplicity, the United
States would probably be what it was
called half a generation ago, &ldquo;a nation
of dyspeptics.&rdquo; And we were a nation
of dyspeptics because the great American
mother of the latter end of the
Nineteenth Century, in spite of all her
unequaled qualities in every other
direction, and in spite of all the encomiums
she received in resounding prose
or ecstatic verse for her prowess in the
kitchen, was from the points of view of
health, economy and wisdom the worst
cook in the world.</p>

<p>With prices as they are the American
housewife cannot afford to use butter
and eggs and flour with the prodigality
that was a habit with her mother, but so
limited is the average woman's knowledge
of cookery that these restrictions
merely mean more monotony than ever.
It is partly to demonstrate that this
state of things is unnecessary and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>true food economy is not at all synonymous
with &ldquo;going without&rdquo; that
this book has been compiled.</p>

<p>It is upon variety that the French
cook confidently relies to make each dish
of each meal not just something to eat
because her family must have food, not
merely a sop to the Cerberus-gnawings
of hunger, but a delight to the eye, to
the palate, to the stomach&mdash;truly a
consummation devoutly to be wished
for the American home table, and just
as possible to attain as it is possible to
procure from the grocer or the nearest
pharmacist the ingredients by which
these wonders are wrought.</p>

<p>But the average American woman
doesn't look beyond her own kitchen
and her own traditional row of spice
boxes for her flavorings. She has her
&ldquo;kitchen set,&rdquo; which ordinarily comprises
a row of little receptacles labeled
&ldquo;pepper,&rdquo; &ldquo;salt,&rdquo; &ldquo;cloves,&rdquo; &ldquo;allspice,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ginger,&rdquo; &ldquo;cinnamon,&rdquo; &ldquo;nutmeg,&rdquo; and
possibly one or two other spices or condiments&mdash;rarely
more. With these and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>a bottle each of lemon extract and
vanilla, she is satisfied that she is fully
equipped as far as flavoring possibilities
are concerned.</p>

<p>If she has laid in a box of sage and one
of mixed dressing with, perhaps, some
paprika and thyme, she views her foresightedness
with much complacency.
She is supplied with savories.</p>

<p>Then she goes right on sighing, &ldquo;Oh,
for a new meat, instead of the same old
round of mutton, pork, beef and fish;
fish, beef, mutton and pork,&rdquo; disclaiming
utterly any responsibility for the
monotony that is undermining the
family health and temper and, quite
possibly, its morals.</p>

<p>That is where the American housewife
makes her primary and most important
mistake. The French, on the
other hand, know that there are, literally,
hundreds of ways to vary every
dish, however ordinary it may be in its
primary state. That is their secret of
success: unfailing variety coupled with
economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>
However, this is not to claim that the
American palate would take kindly to
all the French cooks' little delicacies,
or that it could be cultivated to that
degree that makes a Frenchman regard
a perfectly balanced meal even as an
inspired poem.</p>

<p>Probably Americans, as a class, could
never be induced to eat some of the
little birds&mdash;the <i>mauviettes</i>, the <i>alouettes</i>,
the sparrows baked in a pie, that so
delight the Frenchman. Also, it is a
question whether snails, even if it were
possible to obtain the superior Burgundian,
fat and juicy and cooked even
as our own Oscar used to prepare them
for certain Waldorf guests, would ever
appeal to the American taste, as even
the common hedgerow sort of snail
does to the average Frenchman.</p>

<p>It is not that the French dinners of
Monte Carlo are necessarily so superior
to American shore dinners, or that the
little dinners of Paris are so infinitely
to be preferred to those, say, of certain
places in New Orleans, or that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>coppery-tasting oysters of Havre are
to be compared with those of our own
Baltimore. There is no more to be
said, probably, for the woodcock patés
of old Montreuil, or the <i>rillettes</i> of Tours,
or the little pots of custard one gets at
the foreign Montpelier, or the <i>vol-au-vent</i>,
which is the pride and boast of
the cities of Provence, than there is for
grandmother's cookies such as have
put Camden, Maine, on the map, or
Lady Baltimore cakes, or the chicken
pies one goes to northern New Hampshire
to find in their glory, or the turkeys
that, as much as the Green Mountains,
make Vermont's fame.</p>

<p>Still, there is no question but that
the American palate would benefit much
by being cultivated, not only in the
interests of economy, but also with a
view to the increase of gastronomic
pleasure, for a taste attuned to many
variations is as an ear sensitive to the
nuances of sweet sounds or an eye
trained to perceive delicate tones and
tints. It is really a matter for regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7&ndash;8</a></span>that we, as a people, have not been as
willing to learn from the French the
art of cooking and eating as we have
been to acquire from them knowledge
of the art of dress. Until we widen our
horizon sufficiently to do this, we have
not even begun to develop all our food
resources or to understand the first
principles of true food economy&mdash;which
is not at all synonymous with &ldquo;going
without.&rdquo;</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span></div>
<h2>FLAVOR, HANDMAID OF VARIETY</h2>


<p>It is because he has a multitude of
seasonings at his command and knows
how to use them that the French cook
is enabled not only to send to the table
an infinite variety of dishes, but, at
the same time, to practice economies
that were otherwise impossible. The
American buys an expensive cut of
meat and, as is right in such a case,
treats it as plainly and simply as possible.
The Frenchman buys meat of a
much lower quality, but so embellishes
it that when it comes to the table it is
superior, or, at least, equal to that which
costs much more.</p>

<p>It may be objected that this is no
real economy, because by the time the
French cook has sauced and spiced his
cheap cut in order to make it palatable,
the cost is as great, if not greater than
it would have been had he paid more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>for his meat in the first place. This
would be true enough according to the
average American's method of procedure.
But it is to be remembered that
the French cook has already in his
kitchen the cooking vinegars, the spices,
the dried herbs, the extracts, that in
very small amounts&mdash;a dash or a few
leaves&mdash;are used at a time; also, that
in a great number of cases, gravies and
sauces are made from the by-products
of the main dishes&mdash;those by-products
that in the American kitchen usually
go down the sink-drain or into the garbage
pail.</p>

<p>Take a peep into the typical French
cupboard. There you will find from
twenty-five to thirty liquid seasonings
such as anchovy extract, tobasco sauce,
meat extracts, mushroom catsup, tomato
paste, chutney, various vinegars,
<ins title="Worchestershire">Worcestershire</ins> and many another flavoring
designed to give a tang and a
zest even to the most unpromising dish,
if used aright. There you will find,
too, fifty or more dry seasonings, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>anise, basil, saffron, savoury, clove
or garlic, cassia buds, bay leaf, ginger
root, pepper-corns, marjoram, mint,
thyme, capers and so on.</p>

<p>Herein lie the &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; of French
cookery which are, in truth, not secrets
at all, but merely the application of
common sense to the cuisine. The
French have never allowed their taste
to be restricted by prejudice, so they
hail a new flavor with delight rather
than registering an instinctive dislike
because it is not familiar. With a
little applied education, Americans can
bring the charm of the French table
to their own homes rather than when
they are, as they say, tired of the
same old round of &ldquo;eats,&rdquo; seeking out
a nondescript table d'hôte restaurant
and eagerly consuming what is set
before them, grateful for a change.</p>

<p>But don't harden your heart against
French cookery merely because you
have sampled it, as you fondly think,
at one or another of the &ldquo;red-inkeries&rdquo;
of New York or any other city. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>the most part the &ldquo;French&rdquo; restaurants
of the land are in reality not French
at all, but Italian for the most part,
and whatever Gallic flavor the remainder
ever possessed has well-nigh vanished.
There may be exceptions but,
if there are, their patrons carefully
guard the secret.</p>

<p>But to return to our subject: It is
the French cook's knowledge of the
subtleties, the nuances of seasoning
that stands him in good stead. The
American woman who has essayed to
use some spice or savory unfamiliar to
her and has turned out a dish which her
family has declared &ldquo;tasted like medicine&rdquo;
is, naturally enough, discouraged
from wandering after that particular
strange god again. The truth is that
she has overdone the seasoning. She
doesn't want to be parsimonious, which
is just what the French cook is with
his flavors, only he, more scientifically,
calls it using good judgment. If he
uses garlic in a salad, it doesn't necessarily
follow that the entire household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13">13</a></span>must take on the atmosphere of an
Italian barber shop, for he uses garlic
or onion, not to give their flavor to a
dish, but to bring out the flavors of the
vegetables with which they are used.</p>

<p>Vanilla and lemon have an almost
universal appeal to the palate, and
knowing this, the American cook, like
the generation before her, has always
seasoned her rice puddings, for instance,
with one or the other, just as her apple
sauce has invariably been flavored with
lemon or nutmeg, her bread pudding
with vanilla, and so all along her restricted
line.</p>

<p>The French cook holds no brief
against vanilla, and sometimes he flavors
his rice pudding with it, but he so
guides matters that the very sight or
mention of rice pudding does not bring
the thought of vanilla to the mind, for
with him it may be flavored with
pistache or rose or have a geranium leaf
baked in it, giving a delightful, indescribable
flavor. An ordinary bread
pudding becomes veritably a queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>puddings as, indeed, it is called, merely
by having a layer of jam through its
center and a simple icing spread over
the top. Ordinary pea soup exhibits
chameleon-like possibilities merely
through the addition of a little celery-root,
a dash of curry or the admixture
of a few spoonfuls of minced spinach,
and tomato soup has for most an appeal
that even this favorite of soups never
had before when just the right amount
of thyme is added while it simmers,
along with, perhaps a bayleaf.</p>

<p>In the recipes appended to the little
dinners in this book a great many of the
French cooks' materials and methods
of procedure are set forth. But if the
ordinarily experimental American housewife
has the flavorings on hand, she
will doubtless herself contrive many an
alluring dish of her own. Variety is
said to be the spice of life. However
that may be, the spices and their
friends, the herbs, certainly make for
variety in that important function of
life, the dinner table.</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15">15</a></span></div>
<h2>TRUE TRAILS TOWARD ECONOMY</h2>


<p>In the first place, no trail toward
economy in conducting the cuisine of a
household lies through the delicatessen
store or the &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; grocery. It is an
unflattering comment on the spirit of
thrift of American housewives that the
delicatessen store has settled down to
such a flourishing existence, particularly
in Eastern cities. Any woman
who possesses a stove and a kitchen
of her own should be ashamed to admit
the laziness that more than a semi-occasional
visit to these &ldquo;delicate eating&rdquo;
places predicates. There are few
things to be had in them that she
shouldn't be able to make better at
home and at a cost that is but a fraction
of what she has to pay for the usually
inferior, impersonal messes that come
ready-made.</p>

<p>If the housewife has read some of the
very excellent instructions that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>printed to help her conduct her household
adequately amid the necessary
limitations of wartime, she already
knows that there is absolutely no excuse
for ever throwing away a crust or
crumb of bread. As for that, neither is
there any excuse for ever disposing of
what is left of the <ins title="morn ng">morning</ins> cereal except
to the advantage of some later made
dish, or of consigning meat scraps or
bits of fat or even bones to the garbage
pail. It is not only that, in the interests
of economy, she should use them; it
is rather that if she is a good cook she
will be very glad to have them to use.</p>

<p>Stale bread and breadcrumbs are
the bases of a score of the most delicious
puddings on the French cook's card;
cooked cereal is one of the best thickenings
for soups and gravies, as well as
being far more wholesome than flour for
this purpose; meat scraps, trimmings
and bones should go into the stock pot.
When a soup made of these is served
as the introductory course at dinner
it will be found that the family will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17</a></span>fully satisfied with much less meat, and
it is in the lessening dependence of
Americans on meat that will make for
the greatest item in economy.</p>

<p>A French cook of parts would tear
his hair if he could see how fats and
drippings from meats are thrown away
in many an American kitchen. They
are poured into the sink till the drain
pipes clog and, to complete the little
serial of extravagance, the plumber has
to be called. The French cook knows
that this is the finest grease for frying in
the world and that its use would save
many a pound of butter. He strains
it all carefully and keeps the different
sorts in labelled jars or crocks. He
knows by experience what particular
fats give the best flavors to certain
things, and he knows that vegetables,
fish, eggs, pancakes and what not are
far better fried in these natural fats.
Who that ever ate an egg fried in bacon
drippings will ever want one cooked in
butter, even at a dollar a pound!</p>

<p>One will not find the delicatessen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18">18</a></span>flourishing in France&mdash;one will not
find it at all&mdash;and the fancy grocery,
above mentioned, is another pitfall for
the American housewife. She likes the
sight of food done up in fancy containers,
in glass, perhaps, and buys them,
not realizing that she is paying a large
price for perfectly unnecessary and
totally unnourishing &ldquo;pretties.&rdquo; If she
is fearful of the handling some loose
food stuffs may be subjected to in the
stores, why does she not practice the
most practical economy, go to the
fountain-head of supplies in the city,
the large market, and buy in quantity,
so far as she can? A few ounces of
bacon, already sliced, and sealed in a
glass dish are, indeed, appetising even
in their raw state, while a side of bacon
is not, unless looked upon through the
eyes of imagination, yet the latter
method of purchasing this commodity
is two or three hundred per cent cheaper,
and when it arrives at the breakfast
table it will be found every bit as appealing
to a happy morning appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19">19</a></span>
Any consideration of economy in the
cuisine must include the meat problem.
Meat is the most expensive item on the
menu and the true solution of the question
is not only to conserve all the uses
of it but to eat much less. That would
make not only for economy, but for
better health as well.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that 186 pounds
of dressed meat is&mdash;or was prior to the
war&mdash;the yearly average of consumption
for every American; the Englishman
being a good second with his 120
pounds, while the Frenchman remained
perfectly contented and healthy with
79 pounds, the Italian with 72 pounds,
and the Swiss, anything but a nation of
invalids, managed very well on 60
pounds per person.</p>

<p>This is no plea for vegetarianism,
though it may be said in passing for the
benefit of those who think that good red
blood and hardy muscle are to be obtained
only by absorbing the red blood
and muscle of the beasts of the field,
that there is as much, if not more, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span>this building power in the beans, the
peas, the lentils that we regard too often
as mere secondary foods.</p>

<p>Most of all the American should take
advantage of the great stores of fish
which are equally as nourishing as meat
and may easily be made as appetising
with simple sauces that French cookery
will teach us. Fish are cheap; at least,
many neglected kinds are; they are easy
to cook and they are one of the best
foods in the world.</p>

<h2>THE APPEAL TO THE EYE</h2>


<p>No one, least of all the French cook,
calculates to feast the eye at the expense
of the sense of taste, yet it is his
experience after long years that good
digestion is much more likely to wait
upon the appetite that has been stirred
to a preliminary enthusiasm by the
attractive appearance of a dish. So
they serve little fritters of vegetables,
dabs of jelly, slices of hard boiled eggs,
pickles, parsley, cress and nasturtiums
with meats, put sprigs of fresh green
in their gravies, decorate desserts with
nut-meats, flowers and fruits, and in so
doing add a bit to the gayety of the
table, satisfied that the trifling extra
expense, time and energy incurred is
more than compensated for in the
pleasure the results afford. A fair trial
of this pleasant idiosyncrasy of the
French is convincing that the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>of a dish has more bearing on the
relish of a meal than we over here have
fully realized.</p>

<p>They are particular, however, to be
consistent in the use of garnishings.
Flowers and fruits are reserved for
sweet dishes, except in the case of nasturtiums,
which they regard as much a
vegetable as a flower and use freely with
meats.</p>

<p>A stew or a creamed dish is merely a
more or less indifferent something to eat
when it is dished up any old way and
set upon the table. But if it is heaped
daintily on a pretty platter, surrounded
by a ring of brown mashed potato, its
sides decorated by dainty shapes of
toasted bread, perhaps buttered and
sprinkled with minced parsley, it has
become something to awaken the slumbering
or indifferent appetite and at
practically no extra expense of time or
money.</p>

<p>If the yolks of two hard boiled eggs
are minced and mixed with part of the
raw white of one, the paste then formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23&ndash;24</a></span>into balls like marbles and dropped
into boiling water, one has little yellow
spheres to lend an enlivening color note
to clear soups. Two or three of these
dropped into each plate just before
serving makes a pleasing change from
the usual croutons.</p>

<p>Sprigs of fresh chickory make the
daintiest of garnishes for cold meats,
and a few of the tender green stalks
will add to the appearance of practically
any salad. As for water-cress and
pepper-grass and, of course, parsley,
minced and otherwise, no French chef
would think of preparing a meal without
a plentiful supply of them on hand.</p>

<p>It isn't essential that every dish
should be turned into an elaborate
work of art, as if it were to be entered
at the annual exhibition of the Société
des Chefs de Cuisine, but neither is
there any reason, even with modest
means at command, for giving cause for
that old slogan of the great American
dinner table: &ldquo;It tastes better than it
looks.&rdquo;</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25">25</a></span></div>
<h2>SAUCES, SIMPLE AND OTHERWISE</h2>


<p>Brillat-Savarin, who would be remembered
as a wit had he not been even
more brilliant as a chef, paid his respects
to the English by saying they were a
nation of a hundred religions and only
one sauce. Being a true Frenchman he
believed a reversal of the numbers
better for the soul. It is certainly
better for the appetite.</p>

<p>To be sure the proper mental sauce
for a good dinner is wit, and the best
physical one, hunger, but as we all of
us have more or less of an Epicurean
strain in us and do not eat solely to
satisfy bodily needs, it is well that the
American cook who essays to bring
variety to her board should have some
knowledge of those Gallic creations, the
sauces, by which she is enabled to transform
plain dishes into seemingly pretentious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26">26</a></span>ones, even though she never
attain that sauce that Balzac knew,
&ldquo;in which a mother might unsuspectingly
eat her own child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the first place every French chef
keeps three kinds of what he calls <i>roux</i>
on hand, ready for making meat and
fish sauces. These are made by cooking
together eight ounces of butter and
nine ounces of flour. That intended for
use with brown meats is stirred together
till it becomes a medium brown in shade;
white <i>roux</i> is cooked only sufficiently
to banish the raw taste and not allowed
to color, while pale <i>roux</i> is kept over the
fire just long enough to attain a deep
cream color. These are mixed with
milk, soup stock, water or gravy as
the case may be when a sauce for fish,
meat or vegetables is needed.</p>

<p>For instance, to make <i>Sauce à la
Crème</i>, for use with white entrées, take
two tablespoonfuls of the white <i>roux</i>
in a saucepan with a cup of milk and a
tablespoonful each of finely chopped
parsley, shallots and chives. Boil fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27">27</a></span>minutes, pass through a colander
into another saucepan, add a small
lump of butter, more finely chopped
parsley and salt and pepper. Mix well
with a wooden spoon and it is ready for
the table.</p>

<p>To make a favorite <i>Sauce Piquante</i>,
cut two onions into slices, also a carrot
and two shallots and put into a saucepan
with a scant tablespoonful of butter.
While heating over a moderate
fire, add a sprig of thyme, a tablespoonful
of minced parsley, a bayleaf and two
or three cloves. When the onions are
golden brown add a tablespoonful of
flour, a little plain stock and a tablespoonful
of vinegar. Boil again, pass
through a sieve and season with salt
and pepper.</p>

<p>A simple sauce is that <i>Maître d'Hôtel</i>,
which is rarely made at home though so
generally liked. Put a lump of butter
into a small saucepan over a moderate
fire and add to it chopped <ins title="parsely">parsley</ins> and
chives, or parsley alone. Season with
salt and pepper and a little lemon juice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>and while it is sizzling pour over the
hot steak or fish.</p>

<p><i>Sauce d'Anchois</i>, than which there
isn't anything better with baked fish,
is also easy to make. Take three or
four anchovies and mash them up well
with two tablespoonfuls of butter. Now
make about a pint of brown sauce with
brown <i>roux</i> and milk, and stir the
anchovy butter into it. Just before
taking from the fire add the juice of
half a lemon or more, according to taste.</p>

<p><i>Sauce Bearnaise</i> was a favorite of
Henry of Navarre, and it is excellent
with steaks, chops and, particularly,
roast beef. To make it beat the yolks
of three or four eggs in a saucepan, add
a tablespoonful of butter and a little
salt. Stir over a slow fire till the eggs
begin to thicken, then remove and stir
in two more tablespoonfuls of butter,
stirring till the butter is dissolved.
Season with chopped fine herbs and
parsley and pour in a teaspoonful of
French vinegar.</p>

<p>In many parts of France they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29">29</a></span>a favorite dressing for boiled fish called
<i>Sauce Ravigote</i>. To make it mix half a
pint of stock in a saucepan with a small
amount of white wine or cider, then
chop fine herbs such as chervil, tarragon,
chives and parsley, or whatever
other herbs are in season, to the amount
of about three tablespoonfuls, and mix
with the stock, adding salt and pepper.
Stew gently for about twenty minutes,
then blend a tablespoonful each of
flour and butter, stir into the sauce and
continue to stir till thick. Just before
serving squeeze in the juice of half a
lemon.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;<i>Ravigote</i>&rdquo; means, literally,
&ldquo;pick me up,&rdquo; and it is applied to
minced tarragon, chervil, chives and
parsley, the herbs being kept separate
and served with salad on four little
saucers. <i>Ravigote</i> butter, made by
kneading butter with the four herbs
and adding pepper, salt and lemon
juice, spread between thin slices of
bread, makes delicious sandwiches.</p>

<p>To make the very generally liked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30">30</a></span><i>Sauce Blanquette</i>, which is used to raise
cold meats to the dignity of a fricassée,
take about four ounces of pale <i>roux</i>,
thin slightly with boiling water added
by degrees, then put in a bunch of sweet
herbs, cooked button mushrooms and
small onions and pepper and salt to
taste. Put in whatever cold meat you
have, cook till it is well heated and
serve.</p>

<p>The following is called <i>Sauce d'Havre</i>,
and through the use of it it will be
discovered that the taste of curry is an
agreeable one in many another case
than in connection with the veal and
rice arrangement to which most American
cooks restrict it. Peel and slice
four onions and two apples and place
in a stewpan with four ounces of butter,
six peppercorns, a sprig of thyme, two
bayleaves and a blade of mace. When
the onions have become slightly brown
over the moderate fire, stir in a mixture
of two tablespoonfuls of flour and the
same amount of curry powder, shortly
afterward adding six gills of white stock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31">31</a></span>and half a pint of white sauce. Season
with salt and half a teaspoonful of moist
sugar, boil for a quarter of an hour,
adding more white stock if necessary,
and stirring constantly. Put through
a strainer into another saucepan, boil
up again, skim, and use when required.</p>

<p>Fricasseed chicken takes on a new
glory when it is prepared with <i>Sauce
Lyons</i>. This is made by stirring gradually
three well-beaten eggs into half a
pint of plain white sauce, then placing
the mixture in a jar and standing in
boiling water till the sauce thickens.
Just prior to pouring over the chicken
add the strained juice of half a lemon.</p>

the pan standing in water. Serve hot
with a rum sauce.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">LET US EAT FISH</h2>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">A FAMOUS FRENCH LUNCHEON
À L'AMÉRICAINE</p>


<p>Only in the Latin countries has fish
as an edible ever been fully appreciated
and, as is the case with most other things
gastronomic, it is in France that the
food possibilities of the denizens of the
water have been brought nearest perfection.</p>

<p>Over here we have always seemed to
regard fish as useful chiefly for stocking
aquariums or for furnishing sport for
the vacationist, along with golf, tennis
and bowling. True, we have become
rather well acquainted with certain
sea foods, the oysters, Blue Points and
Cape Cods; we have a nodding acquaintance
with some of the clam clan, especially
the Rhode Island branch, and the
Little Necks, the blue bloods of the
family. And, of course, we are familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110">110</a></span>with the crustaceans, the lobsters and
the crabs.</p>

<p>And we know, too, certain succulent
sea delicacies that come to us from Palm
Beach shores and California and Oregon
regions, tuna and halibut, bluefish and
salmon as it comes to us variously prepared
for the table. In short, we Americans
are fairly friendly with a number
of the aristocrats of the water, but on
analyzing the situation we come to
realize that as for knowing the &ldquo;finny
tribe&rdquo; as a whole well enough to get
complete gastronomic joy out of the
situation, it remains that it is only the
French people who are so blessed.</p>

<p>Time and the hour and the high price
of meat, however, render it advisable,
even absolutely necessary, that we work
<em>all</em> our resources instead of only a part
of them, to economize whenever and
wherever we can, and the waters in our
midst and around us are surely one of
the most important resources not already
worked to the limit.</p>

<p>Therefore, let us eat fish&mdash;but first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111">111</a></span>let us learn of the French about fish,
even as we have learned of them concerning
other foods, or as we have
learned fashions, for, verily, the turning
out of a proper fish dish for the table
has ever been regarded by the French
as no less an art than the creation of a
beautiful frock in one of their ateliers.
Moreover, their ways with fish are so
broadly inclusive that one may make
up an entire menu from one end to the
other, with only a cup of coffee needed
as a final fillip to make a perfect meal&mdash;and
all of fish.</p>

<p>By way of furnishing inspiration to
our own appetites, herewith is a suggestion
for a fish luncheon, a favorite
menu of France, which its wealth and
fashion delighted to have set before it
in those good old days before the war.
Substitutes are given for any fish not
indigenous to American waters; otherwise
it is just as it would be served at one
of the Riviera restaurants, with the
exception, of course, that on the
Riviera or at any of the noted marine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>restaurants, the visitor himself was permitted
to select the fish for each course
from among the different specimens
swimming in the reserves, altogether
unconscious of impending fate.</p>

<p>No French restauranteur worthy the
name ever kept dead fish in stock, for
nothing deteriorates so quickly. There
is rarely over here the natural reserve
that the Riviera takes as a matter of
course, although there is, in some restaurants,
the tank of running water in
which the fish are kept in condition till
required.</p>

<h2>AN ALL FISH LUNCHEON</h2>


<h3>MENU</h3>

<div id="fish-luncheon">
<h4>Hors d'&OElig;uvres. Little Necks or Blue Points.</h4>

<p>(At Monte Carlo one would be served Clovisses.)</p>

<h4>Lobster with Sauce Piquante.</h4>

<p>(A substitute for the French langouste, which is
similar to a giant lobster minus the two long
nippers. Or there might be served abroad for
this course a little gelatinous fellow called supion,
or sea-hedgehog, or perhaps nonnots, smaller and
more delicate than our own whitefish.)</p>

<h4>French Sardines Grilled, or Shad Planked.</h4>

<p>(Shad is a most satisfactory substitute for the
French restauranteur's delight&mdash;loup de mer.)</p>

<h4>Flounder, Sauce Meunière, or Shrimps.</h4>

<p>(In Dieppe sole and certain crevettes are both
specialties and are served at this juncture, but
little sole is being received here and our own
flounder answers requirements admirably. Shrimps,
too, will please an American palate fully as well as
the <ins title="crevettes.">crevettes.)</ins></p>

<h4>Bouillabaisse.</h4>

<p>(This, for which we have no nearer synonym than
fish stew, which is a libel, is the pièce de résistance
of the luncheon. It is probably the most famous
fish dish of France.)</p>

<h4>Salade de Poisson with Aioli.</h4>

<p>(Aioli is a Mediterranean mayonnaise and &ldquo;the
dressing,&rdquo; the French say, &ldquo;is the soul of the
<ins title="salad.&rdquo;">salad.&rdquo;)</ins></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114">114</a></span>
It will be noted that there is no
dessert given with the above menu,
but the repast may be gracefully topped
off with crackers and cheese and café
noir. Tea is never served with fish, as
the tannin is said to render fish particularly
indigestible.</p>



<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span></div>
<h3>TO PREPARE THE LUNCHEON</h3>

<p>The French disdain the pepper, horseradish
and tomato mixtures with which
we are wont to dress raw oysters, preferring
to get the full coppery taste
peculiar to their home product, but the
American oyster, even these artists of
the culinary department agree, requires
a dressing to bring out the flavor.
As for the clovisse, which is, by the way,
first cousin to our clam, it is eaten from
the shell, each clovisse being opened
immediately before being disposed of.</p>

<p>Lobster as here served to take the
place of the French langouste, tastes
much like deviled lobster. The sauce
piquante is made as follows: Into a
saucepan put a tablespoonful of finely
chopped onion with a little salt, grated
nutmeg, black pepper and an ounce of
butter. When this melts and blends
add a little chopped red pepper along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116">116</a></span>with three tablespoonfuls of vinegar
and a teaspoonful of mustard. Stir
together well, then mix in half an ounce
of flour and half a pint of fish stock.
Simmer for half an hour, skimming
occasionally and, finally add a chopped
pickled gherkin.</p>

<p><b>Sauce Meunière</b>, served with the sole,
or, in this case with the flounder, is
made by adding a few shrimps and mussels,
minced, to a pint of white wine in a
saucepan, along with a cupful of minced
mushrooms, a teaspoonful of butter,
salt and pepper and three or four cloves.
Simmer for twenty minutes and pour
over the fish just before serving.</p>

<p><b>Salade de Poisson, Aioli</b>, is made by taking
any cold fish, say salmon, with this
menu. It is flaked and marinaded in
oil and vinegar seasoned well with pepper
and salt. Allow to remain for an
hour or so, then remove and arrange
compactly in a salad bowl. The aioli,
the Mediterranean delicacy with which
it is served, is made by whipping two
eggs, four teaspoonfuls of olive oil, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117">117</a></span>half teaspoonful of French mustard
and a half cupful of cream together
till stiff, in a bowl rubbed with garlic.
Heap this on the center of the fish.</p>

<p>As for the <b>Bouillabaisse</b>, it is like our
own Welsh Rabbit in so far as hardly
any two persons make it alike. Here
are two recipes which gastronomic authorities
have accorded the meed of
highest praise:</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Cut into pieces and remove
the bones from three pounds of fish;
say one pound each of cod, halibut and
bluefish, though any fish of like nature
will do. To these add the cooked meat
of one lobster or two crabs, and six
shrimps and put all into a casserole in
half a pint or more of olive oil to cook,
adding one lemon, sliced, two tomatoes,
one onion, one sliced carrot, a bunch of
saffron, a bunch of parsley, a bayleaf
and a clove of garlic&mdash;or have the
casserole rubbed with the garlic. Cook
for ten minutes, stirring frequently,
then add one cup of soup stock and a
glass of wine or cider. Cook for fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118">118</a></span>minutes longer, remove to a hot bowl,
line the casserole with slices of toast,
and pour back the bouillabaisse. Serve
at once.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Place the pieces of fish to
any desired amount in a large saucepan,
add two or three sliced onions, one or
two sliced carrots, three shallots, two
cloves of garlic, a bunch of thyme and
parsley, three or four cloves, two bayleaves,
half a teaspoonful of capsicum,
a wine-glass of olive oil and salt and
pepper to taste. Pour over the above
mixture two quarts of water and boil
gently for half an hour, the pan covered.
Drain and lay on a hot dish. Then mix
a teaspoonful of saffron in the liquid,
pass through a strainer into a soup
tureen. Serve the soup with the fish
and a plate of croutons of fried bread or
sippets of toast.</p>

<h2>FISH À LA MARSEILLES</h2>


<p>The French have another fish dish
which, like bouillabaisse, is practically
a meal in itself and which in these
days should be better known to the
American table. It is a specialty in the
vicinity of Marseilles and made there,
of course, with fish peculiar to the home
waters, but M.&nbsp;Auguste Gay, Chef of
the Yale Club, New York, who, incidentally,
has probably given more attention
to the adaptation of French cookery
to American requirements than any
other chef, is authority for the statement
that the following recipe produces
an almost perfect substitute for the
French dish:</p>

<p>Chop into fine bits a small sweet
Chile pepper and toss it about in a
saucepan over the fire with a third of a
cupful of olive oil or butter. When hot
add a cupful of okra and the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120">120</a></span>amount of stewed fresh or canned tomatoes.
Cook fifteen minutes and add a
full cupful of cooked fresh fish&mdash;cod,
haddock, etc., and a half cupful of
flaked salt fish, mackerel, for instance.
Cover and cook for twenty minutes
longer and serve with water crackers.</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121">121</a></span></div>
<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>


<p>One secret of the French cook's
superiority to the American in preparing
fish is that the former has almost a congenital
knowledge of his subject. To
him all fish is not just fish. He differentiates
sharply as to species, tempering
his treatment to varied requirements.</p>

<p>Roughly, there are two classes of fish:
those which have dark flesh or flesh
with a pinkish tone which is streaked
with fat, and those which have white,
firm flesh and are the more digestible.
Best known in the first class are shad,
butterfish, bluefish, salmon, mackerel
and sturgeon, and in the second, cod,
halibut, flounder, trout, rock and sea
bass, pompano, weakfish and perch.</p>

<p>One matter-of-course rule is that no
fish of whatever kind shall be allowed
to enter the kitchen unless it is perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122">122</a></span>fresh. To be sure of this see that
the gills are bright and shining and the
flesh firm, not readily separating from
the bones. That settled, you have an
almost endless choice of ways of cooking.</p>

<p>Fish may be boiled, broiled, fried,
baked, planked, creamed, steamed,
cooked en casserole, jellied or pickled,
but of all these ways none produces
quite the universally satisfactory results
with a sizable fish that planking
does, and planking is not more difficult
or expensive than other methods.</p>

<p>All that is required in the way of
accoutrements is a half-inch-thick hardwood
board which is heated in advance
in the oven when planked fish is to
figure on the menu. Then having thoroughly
cleaned the fish, removed its
head and tail, split it up the back half
through the bone so that it will open out
flat, brush it with butter and season
with pepper and salt, place it skin-side
down on the board.</p>

<p>Put it in the oven and when it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123">123</a></span>done, which can be easily ascertained
by lifting a bit of the flesh, you, being
American, may garnish the board with
mashed and seasoned potatoes, set the
board back in the oven till the potatoes
are browned and serve. The French, on
taking the cooked fish from the oven,
merely brush it with a little oil or melted
butter, squeeze some lemon juice over,
sprinkle a few bits of parsley about,
and send the fish thus to the table.</p>

<p>Small fish, such as perch, smelts, etc.,
are best fried in deep fat or its substitute,
first being dipped in egg and rolled
in fine cracker or breadcrumbs, then
served with a Sauce Mousseline, mashed
potatoes or boiled new ones, and a crisp
salad.</p>

<p>This Sauce Mousseline is made by
beating two eggs in a saucepan, adding
a cupful of top milk, butter the size of
a walnut and pepper and salt, then stirring
over the fire till it begins to thicken.
When of the proper consistency, add a
tablespoonful of lemon juice and it is
ready for the table.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 120px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124">124</a></span>
A tart sauce for boiled fish that is
much favored in the south of France
but which, if it has ever crossed the
water, has kept its arrival very quiet,
is quite simply made and will be much
liked as a decided change. To make it
dissolve a tablespoonful of powdered
mustard in a half cupful of fish stock
and add two tablespoonfuls of white
wine vinegar by preference, though
other vinegar will do. Let this come to
a boil, add two or three slices of lemon
and boil a few minutes longer. Take
from the fire and add two eggs that have
been beaten with a teaspoonful of water.
Season with salt and pepper and heat
again but do not allow to boil.</p>
